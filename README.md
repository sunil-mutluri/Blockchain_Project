# 💓 Decentralized Heart Rate Monitoring System (DHRMS)

## 📖 Abstract

The **Decentralized Heart Rate Monitoring System (DHRMS)** is a blockchain-based web application (DApp) that empowers individuals to take control of their heart health while enabling secure data sharing with verified healthcare organizations. 

Built on Ethereum and integrated with real-time heart rate APIs, this platform allows users to:
- Continuously monitor their heart rate,
- Earn HTK tokens as rewards for maintaining healthy vitals,
- Share health data with hospitals and research institutions — all while preserving data privacy through decentralized storage and smart contracts.

By combining Web3 technologies with health IoT data, this project reimagines patient engagement, data ownership, and incentivized wellness in a trustless environment.
